the cursor is being followed by a donut (the big one)
and homers differenect pics of him tries to catch 

increase the range of the homer

wolverine can instantly kill you
hulk can break walls and donut station( where the donut is rehabilatating)



1)when some key is pressed mark all donuts
   2) when a donut is marked he can follow the donut  ~done
    else it will follow its last command    ~done

create homer leveling system


kamikaze logic:
    when he collides with homer the donut explodes, explodes on command, when exploding move everything everywhere
