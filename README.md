In a land where the yellow race has taken control of the whole world no matter how look there eyes.
  Stands not one but whole army of donuts. They are not to be taken prisoners by this pitiful human being called Sprangfielders. They shall fight to the last donut. But here lies the aggression, the oppressor called Homer Simpsons with the help of his anger lesser than that of Gandi. The guy who mothefuckin atom bombed when were friends I am Ramsess, but peaple call me "The Great". Will fight to eliminate the threat you oppose. So choose what you will be Homer or the Donut Moisey, who will lead your peaple to a new land and build a donutulandia, that will stand the test of time.
